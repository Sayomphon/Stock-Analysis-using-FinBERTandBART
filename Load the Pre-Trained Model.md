## The code initializes a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification by loading it from the Hugging Face Transformers library
```python
# Load the pre-trained model
pretrained_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
```
This line of code loads a pre-trained model for sequence classification tasks, specifically the BERT model.
  - Function:
    - AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(...): This function from the Hugging Face Transformers library is used to load a pre-trained model for sequence classification.
    - 'bert-base-uncased': Specifies the pre-trained BERT model version to be loaded. "Uncased" means that the model treats uppercase and lowercase letters as equivalent (e.g., "Apple" and "apple" are treated the same).
  - Parameters:
    - num_labels=2: Specifies that the model is being configured for a binary classification task, where the output can be one of two labels.
