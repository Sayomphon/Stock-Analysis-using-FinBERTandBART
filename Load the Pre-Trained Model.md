## The code initializes a pre-trained BERT model for sequence classification by loading it from the Hugging Face Transformers library
```python
# Load the pre-trained model
pretrained_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2)
```
Loads a pre-trained model from the Hugging Face model hub, specifically for sequence classification tasks.
  - AutoModelForSequenceClassification: A class from the Hugging Face Transformers library designed to automatically select the appropriate sequence classification model based on the specified pre-trained model.
  - from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=2): Loads the BERT model in its "base" configuration with "uncased" text processing, setting it up for a sequence classification task with 2 labels.
    - 'bert-base-uncased': Specifies the pre-trained model to be loaded. In this case, it's the "BERT base" model that doesn't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase letters.
    - num_labels=2: Configures the model for a classification task with two possible labels (e.g., binary classification for sentiment analysis like positive and negative).
