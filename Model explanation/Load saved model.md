## This code snippet loads a fine-tuned model and its associated tokenizer from the directory specified by the saved_model_path variable ('./saved_model').
```python
# Load saved model
saved_model_path = './saved_model'
fine_tuned_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(saved_model_path)
fine_tuned_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(saved_model_path)
```
### Load Saved Model Path
Defines the path where the saved fine-tuned model and tokenizer are stored.
```python
saved_model_path = './saved_model'
```
  - saved_model_path: This variable holds the directory path ('./saved_model') where the fine-tuned model and tokenizer have been saved.
### Load Fine-Tuned Model
Loads the fine-tuned model from the specified directory.
```python
fine_tuned_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(saved_model_path)
```
  - fine_tuned_model: This variable stores the loaded fine-tuned model.
  - AutoModelForSequenceClassification: A class from the transformers library (by Hugging Face) used to load models suitable for sequence classification tasks.
  - from_pretrained(saved_model_path): A method used to load the model's weights and configuration from the directory path stored in saved_model_path.
### Load Fine-Tuned Tokenizer
Loads the tokenizer associated with the fine-tuned model from the specified directory.
```python
fine_tuned_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(saved_model_path)
```
  - fine_tuned_tokenizer: This variable stores the loaded fine-tuned tokenizer.
  - AutoTokenizer: A class from the transformers library used to load tokenizers compatible with pre-trained or fine-tuned models.
  - from_pretrained(saved_model_path): A method used to load the tokenizer's configuration and vocabulary files from the directory path stored in saved_model_path.
