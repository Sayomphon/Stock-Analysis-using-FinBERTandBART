## The code extracts the text and label data from the training and validation (test) sets of the dataset.
```python
# Split into training and validation sets
train_texts = dataset['train']['text']
train_labels = dataset['train']['label']
val_texts = dataset['test']['text']
val_labels = dataset['test']['label']
```
This section of the code is used to split the loaded dataset into training and validation sets, specifically extracting the texts and their corresponding labels for each set.
  - Variables:
    - train_texts: This variable stores the text data for the training set.
    - train_labels: This variable stores the labels corresponding to the text data in the training set.
    - val_texts: This variable stores the text data for the validation set (sometimes referred to as the test set).
    - val_labels: This variable stores the labels corresponding to the text data in the validation set.
  - Dataset Structure:
    - dataset['train']['text']: Accesses the text data from the training partition of the dataset.
    - dataset['train']['label']: Accesses the label data from the training partition of the dataset.
    - dataset['test']['text']: Accesses the text data from the validation (test) partition of the dataset.
    - dataset['test']['label']: Accesses the label data from the validation (test) partition of the dataset.
