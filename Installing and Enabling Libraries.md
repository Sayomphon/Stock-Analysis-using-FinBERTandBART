```
### requests
```python
import requests
```
This library is used for making HTTP requests, such as calling APIs to fetch data from web servers.
### pandas
```python
import pandas as pd
```
This library is used for managing and analyzing tabular data (data frames). pd is a commonly used alias for pandas.
### transformers from Hugging Face
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, pipeline, TrainingArguments, Trainer, T5Tokenizer, T5ForConditionalGeneration, default_data_collator, EarlyStoppingCallback, BartTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration
```
This library is used for handling advanced language models used in NLP (Natural Language Processing).
  - AutoTokenizer: Helps in converting text into tokens that can be used with models.
  - AutoModelForSequenceClassification: A model specialized in sequence classification tasks.
  - pipeline: A helper for managing NLP task pipelines like text classification and summarization.
  - TrainingArguments: Defines the parameters for training the model.
  - Trainer: An object used to train and evaluate the model.
  - default_data_collator: Helps in collating data properly for training.
  - EarlyStoppingCallback: Helps in stopping training when no improvement is seen for a specified period.
  - BartTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration: Used with BART models for text summarization.
### torch
```python
import torch
```
This library is used for numerical computation and deep learning. It is highly efficient with GPU (graphics card) processing for complex computations.
ipywidgets:
import ipywidgets as widgets

This library is used for creating interactive widgets in Jupyter Notebooks.
IPython.display:
from IPython.display import display, HTML

This library helps in displaying objects in Jupyter Notebooks and can display HTML content.
re:
import re

This library is used for handling regular expressions, which helps in searching and managing text based on specified patterns.
plotly.graph_objects:
import plotly.graph_objects as go

This library helps in creating interactive graphs like candlestick charts for stock data visualization.
sentence-transformers:
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

This library is used to transform sentences into vectors for mathematical analysis and machine learning.
datasets:
from datasets import load_dataset, load_metric

This library is used for loading ready-to-use datasets and testing NLP models with metrics.
load_dataset: Function to load various datasets for training and testing models.
load_metric: Function to load metrics for model evaluation.
torch.utils.data:
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

This library manages datasets for model training in PyTorch.
sklearn.metrics:
from sklearn.metrics import precision_recall_fscore_support

This library is used for evaluating and measuring the performance of machine learning models, particularly for calculating precision, recall, and F1-score.
