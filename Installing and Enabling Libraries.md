### Data Analysis
```python
import pandas as pd
```
Manages and analyzes tabular data.pd is a commonly used alias for pandas.
### Transformer Models from Hugging Face
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, pipeline, TrainingArguments, Trainer, default_data_collator, EarlyStoppingCallback, BartTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration
```
Handles advanced language models used in Natural Language Processing (NLP).
  - AutoTokenizer: Converts text into tokens for models.
  - AutoModelForSequenceClassification: Specialized in text classification tasks.
  - pipeline: Manages NLP task pipelines.
  - TrainingArguments: Sets parameters for training the model.
  - Trainer: Trains and evaluates the model.
  - default_data_collator: Collates data for training.
  - EarlyStoppingCallback: Stops training when no improvement is detected.
  - BartTokenizer, BartForConditionalGeneration: Used with BART models for text summarization.
