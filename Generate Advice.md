## Designe to generate a summarized version of a given text prompt using a pre-trained BART model.
```python
# Function to generate advice using BART
def generate_advice(prompt):
    inputs = bart_tokenizer.encode("summarize: " + prompt, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
    summary_ids = bart_model.generate(inputs, max_length=512, min_length=200, length_penalty=2.0, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
    return bart_tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```
### Function Definition:
The function generate_advice is defined to take a single parameter prompt, which is the input text for which advice (or a summary) is to be generated.
```python
def generate_advice(prompt):
```
### Tokenizing the Input
bart_tokenizer.encode is used to tokenize the input text.
```python
    inputs = bart_tokenizer.encode("summarize: " + prompt, return_tensors="pt", max_length=512, truncation=True)
```
  - The input text is concatenated with the prefix "summarize: " to instruct the BART model to generate a summary.
  - return_tensors="pt": This argument specifies that the tokenized input should be returned as a PyTorch tensor.
  - max_length=512: The maximum length of the tokenized input. Longer inputs will be truncated to 512 tokens.
  - truncation=True: This ensures that inputs longer than the maximum length are truncated.
### Generating the Summary
bart_model.generate is used to generate the summary from the tokenized input.
```python
    summary_ids = bart_model.generate(inputs, max_length=512, min_length=200, length_penalty=2.0, num_beams=4, early_stopping=True)
```
  - inputs: The tokenized input tensor.
  - max_length=512: The maximum length for the generated summary.
  - min_length=200: The minimum length for the generated summary.
  - length_penalty=2.0: Length penalty to control the length of the output; higher values result in shorter summaries.
  - num_beams=4: Number of beams for beam search (a search algorithm that optimizes the generation process for better results).
  - early_stopping=True: Stop the beam search when at least num_beams of the generated sequences are finished.
### Decoding the Summary
bart_tokenizer.decode is used to convert the token ids generated by the model back into human-readable text.
```python
    return bart_tokenizer.decode(summary_ids[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
```
  - summary_ids[0]: Takes the first generated summary from the list of generated summaries.
  - skip_special_tokens=True: This argument removes special tokens that might be present in the generated text, such as [CLS], [SEP], etc.
