## Designe to fetch the latest financial news for a specified stock symbol
```python
# Function to fetch financial news
def get_latest_news(symbol, api_key):
    news_url = f'https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q={symbol}&apiKey={api_key}'
    response = requests.get(news_url)
    return response.json()
```
### Structure of the Function
The function is named get_latest_news and it takes two parameters: symbol and api_key:
```python
def get_latest_news(symbol, api_key):
```
symbol: A string representing the stock symbol you want to search news for (e.g., AAPL for Apple, MSFT for Microsoft).
api_key: The API key required to make requests to the News API.
### Building the Request URL
Inside the function, it constructs a URL to make the API request:
```python
    news_url = f'https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q={symbol}&apiKey={api_key}'
```
  - base URL: 'https://newsapi.org/v2/everything' is the endpoint provided by the News API for general news search.
  - query string: q={symbol} adds the provided symbol to the query to search for relevant news articles.
  - apiKey: apiKey={api_key} appends the user's API key to the query to authenticate the request.
### Making the HTTP Request
The function sends an HTTP GET request to the constructed URL to fetch the news data:
```python    
    response = requests.get(news_url)
```
  - The requests.get(news_url) function call sends an HTTP GET request to the specified URL and waits for a response from the server.
### Returning the Response
Finally, the function returns the response data in JSON format:
    return response.json()
  - response.json() converts the server's response to JSON, which is a standard format for API responses and is easy to work with in Python.
