## Generate dense vector representations, also known as embeddings, for a given input text
```python
def get_embeddings(text):
    embeddings = sentence_encoder.encode(text)
    return embeddings
```
### Defining the function
```python
def get_embeddings(text):
```
This line defines a function named get_embeddings that takes one parameter text, which is expected to be the input text for which embeddings are to be generated.
### Generating embeddings
```python    
    embeddings = sentence_encoder.encode(text)
```
This line uses the sentence_encoder (a SentenceTransformer model previously loaded) to encode the input text into embeddings. The method encode processes the input text and converts it into a dense numerical vector that captures the semantic meaning of the text.
### Returning the embeddings
 ```python   
    return embeddings
```
This line returns the generated embeddings as the output of the function.
