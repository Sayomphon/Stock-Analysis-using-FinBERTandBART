## Generate dense vector representations, also known as embeddings, for a given input text
```python
def get_embeddings(text):
    embeddings = sentence_encoder.encode(text)
    return embeddings
```
### Defining the function
```python
def get_embeddings(text):
```
Defines a function named get_embeddings to generate embeddings for the given text.
  - text: A string containing the input text for which embeddings are to be generated.
### Generating embeddings
```python    
    embeddings = sentence_encoder.encode(text)
```
Computes the embeddings of the input text using a pre-initialized sentence encoder.
  - sentence_encoder: Assumes sentence_encoder is a pre-initialized instance of a model or library (such as SentenceTransformer) that can generate embeddings.
  - encode(text): Method that takes the input text and returns its embeddings as a numerical vector.
#### Example:
If text is "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.", sentence_encoder.encode(text) converts it into a high-dimensional numerical vector that represents the semantic meaning of the text.
### Returning the embeddings
 ```python   
    return embeddings
```
Returns the generated embeddings as the output of the function.
  - embeddings: The numerical vector representing the embeddings of the input text.
