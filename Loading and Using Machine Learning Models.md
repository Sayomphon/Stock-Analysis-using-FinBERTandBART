## Load several pretrained models and tokenizers from various sources
```python
# Load models
finbert_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')
finbert_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')
bart_tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn')
bart_model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn')
sentence_encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')
```
This section of the code loads various pre-trained models and their corresponding tokenizers, setting them up for use in tasks such as sentiment analysis, text summarization, and sentence embedding.
### Loading the FinBERT Tokenizer and Model
```python
finbert_tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')
finbert_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone')
```
  - finbert_tokenizer:
    - AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone'): Loads the tokenizer for the FinBERT model, which is specialized for financial sentiment analysis.
  - finbert_model:
    - AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained('yiyanghkust/finbert-tone'): Loads the FinBERT model for sequence classification, which can classify text into sentiment categories (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
### Loading the BART Tokenizer and Model for Summarization:
```python
bart_tokenizer = BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn')
bart_model = BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn')
```
  - bart_tokenizer:
    - BartTokenizer.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn'): Loads the tokenizer for the BART model (specifically the 'bart-large-cnn' variant), which is used for tasks like text summarization.
  - bart_model:
    - BartForConditionalGeneration.from_pretrained('facebook/bart-large-cnn'): Loads the BART model for conditional text generation, which is commonly used for generating summaries of input text.
### Loading a Sentence Transformer Model
```python
sentence_encoder = SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2')
```
  - sentence_encoder:
    - SentenceTransformer('all-mpnet-base-v2'): Loads the Sentence-BERT model, specifically the 'all-mpnet-base-v2' variant. This model is used for generating sentence embeddings, capturing the semantic meaning of sentences in numerical form.
