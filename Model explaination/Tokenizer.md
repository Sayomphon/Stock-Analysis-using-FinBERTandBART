## Code initializes a pre-trained BERT tokenizer using the Hugging Face library.
```python
# Tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
```
This line of code initializes a tokenizer, which is responsible for converting text into a format that can be fed into a machine learning model.
  - Function:
    - AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased'): This function call loads a pre-trained tokenizer from the Hugging Face library. Specifically, it loads the tokenizer for the BERT model with the configuration 'bert-base-uncased'. The 'uncased' configuration means that the tokenizer ignores case, meaning it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same (e.g., "Apple" and "apple" are treated identically).
  - Variable:
    - tokenizer: The variable tokenizer is assigned the pre-trained BERT tokenizer, allowing it to be used to tokenize text data later in the script.
